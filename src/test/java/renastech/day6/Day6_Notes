How do we handle web tables using Selenium webdriver?

	-> We create specific xpath locators to locate what we want to get from the table itself.


How do we handle web tables?
	- By creating custom locators to get whatever I need to get from the table.
	-> If I need to get the whole row, I create a locator that returns me the whole row.
	-> If I need to get 1 single cell, I need to create a locator that returns me 1 single cell.


//table[@id='ctl00_MainContent_orderGrid']/tbody/tr

//table[@id='ctl00_MainContent_orderGrid']//tr

ALERTS
	There are two types of alerts.
	1- HTML Alerts:
		-> How do we handle: We just locate just as another web element on the page.
		-> Then we click.

	2- JavaScript Alerts:

	HOW DO WE HANDLE ALERTS?
		-> Using Alerts.
		-> JS alerts are not part of the HTML structure. Therefore we need to switch the driver focus to the alert itself.
		1- Create an instance of Alert, then switch to alert.
		  		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		2-  to accept, dismiss
			alert.accept();
			alert.dismiss();


IFRAMES

-> Iframes are basically <html> inside of another <html>
-> Selenium can only focus one thing at a time.
So we need to SWITCH driver's focus to the inner iframe to be able to perform any action with Selenium.
-> There are 3 ways to switch to iframes

	1- Locating as WebElement then using that webElement to switch.
	WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(LOCATOR);
	driver.switchTo.frame(iframe);

	2- Switching by index. We pass the index number of the frame.
	-> if you have more than one iframe on the page, indexes are used.
	<iframe> --> index 0
	<iframe> --> index 1
	<iframe> --> index 2

	driver.switchTo.frame(0);

	3- Switching by id or name attribute value.
	driver.switchTo.frame("idValue");
	driver.switchTo.frame("nameValue");


Questions :

1. Why are you using Selenium ? (What is the advantage of using Selenium)
-Multiple Language such as: Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JS...
-Multiple Browsers
-Open source (its free)
-different operation systems (OS), such as: Mac, Windows, Linux.

2.What is the webelement ?
- Everything that you see on the page is a web element
- such as links,buttons,input boxes, checkbox ,images etc.

3.how many locaters
--8 locaters we have

4 What happens when findElement method cannot locate a webElement?
 	-> It throws NoSuchElementException

5. What is return type of findElement method
-- WebElement

6.WHAT IS MAVEN? Why we use maven project ?
--maven is a built automation tool
--it help us to create our automatin framework with some librarries
-- it has pom.xml
    (pom.xml is helpingg us to get dependcy outside (libraarry : ready methods ))

7. Differences of Thread.Sleep impilict wait
-- thread.sleep will wait until given time and its going to stop excution
-- impilicit wait will wait until page got loadded -- it wont wait until given time

8.HOW DO WE HANDLE CHECKBOXES AND RADIO BUTTONS USING SELENIUM?
-- we need to locate them and then you can also click
//to check their funcnality
    --isSeleceted or isEnabled method will help you .

9.How do we handle dynamic web elements?
-- if the webelement attribute value are changing when you refreshing page that means your webelemeny is dynamic
-- custom methods xpath method will help you to handle this issue.

syntax: Custom Methods
		//div[contains(@attribute, ‘value’)] -- use static part of the value
		//div[starts-with(@attribute, ‘value’)]
		//div[ends-with(@attribute, ‘value’)]

id=hello25 -- dynamic element
refresh page
id=hello37 -- dynamic element
refresh page
id=hello94 -- dynamic element

//div[contains(@id, ‘hello’)]

10. Differences Css and Xpath
-- Xpath has custom methods but css doesnt have those
-- Xpath has abilty to go from child to parrent and parent to child
-- but in css you can only go from parent to child
-- css it works little faster then Xpath
--
