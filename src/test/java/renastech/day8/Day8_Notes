-What is hardcoding?
    -harcoding means passing every data inside of class without using any utils or files
	-> if you hard code, to be able to change the test data
	you have to go to each test and change the data from there.

-Data Driven Testing is running the same test against different datas.
	- instead of hardcoding tes data inside of test
	- We created a properties file and we keep our test data in the file.


PropertiesReading utility class
	-> to be able to read from .properties type of file, we created util class.
	-> steps to read from properties file:
		1- Creating the object from Properties class
		Properties properties = new Properties();
		2- We need to OPEN the file in
			FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("path");
		3- We need to load the file to properties object.
			properties.load(file);
		4- We close the previously opened file
			file.close();
//by hiding properties object and getting this object in the getter method is basicaaly an example of encapsulation
