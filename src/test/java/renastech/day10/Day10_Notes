 //to be able to do scroll down
        //you have 2 option
            //1.actions move to the element
        //need to create an object from actions
        Actions actions=new Actions(DriverUtil.getDriver());
        actions.moveToElement(ifreme).perform();

            //2.JS excuter

        JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor=(JavascriptExecutor) DriverUtil.getDriver();
        //to make jsexecuter works you need to do casting between driver and jsexcuter

        BrowserUtils.wait(3);
        javascriptExecutor.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);",ifreme);


Either for actions or jsexcuter first you need to create connection the place that they are going to work which is driver
    in actions class created with constracturor and it has webdriver so you can pass
            Actions actions=new Actions(DriverUtil.getDriver());

   in jsexcuter since it has no constractor to make jsexcuter to understand where is going to be connect which is driver
   //you need to cast with driver
           JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor=(JavascriptExecutor) DriverUtil.getDriver();
